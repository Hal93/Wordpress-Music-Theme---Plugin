MusicMate is a plugin designed to help music website owners by providing them with useful functionality to easily setup an online store
to sell items through OScommerce but to also write album reviews using specialised genres which admins can publish and add pages.

== Description ==

Musicmate is specifically designed for music blog admins to easily create album reviews on their facvourite artists. Musicmate makes it easy for 
admins to publish reviews to their blog by adding pages. The reviews use specialised taxonomies like genre and categories to effectively which 
helps users match their favourite music genre with reviews. Musicmate makes it simple for music site admins to add reviews, delete reviews, edit 
reviews, add genres and categories or even add custom fields to enhance album reviews. 

Not only does Musicmate allow website admins to create reviews but it also gives admins an E-Commerce solution using OScommerce. Webiste admins can easily connect to the store and display available products on their website. Products may include music albums, singles, merchandise, music hardware. However this solution is flexible enough to accommodate any type of products admins want to sell. The solution effectively displays the admin's products on their website by adding a sidebar widget. Users can easily view products and click on them. Once items are clicked, it redirects them to the admin's OScommerce store where users can purchase the item using credit card and visa payment. 

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `Musicmate` plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of Wordpress
2. Activate the Musicmate plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Once activated Album Review menu item is added to the admin's dashboard. It contains sub items to add review and add genres. 
4. Also the plugin adds the E-Commerce store menu item. Here the admin needs to provide their store's database information in 
   order to display products to users. Once a connection is set up, it saves the admins information and then displays their 
   products for users to purchase. The products are displayed in a sidebar widget. 
5. Please be aware, the pre-requisites of the Musicmate plugin are that an admin has created an account with OScommerce and have a oscommerce 
   package locally stored. 

== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) ==

= How do I write a review? =

To write a review, simply go to the admin dashboard. Click "album reviews" and then choose add review. Once there, it is 
a familiar layout to adding posts. Reviews can contain text, posts, quotes or shortcodes. When complete, simply 
publish the review. 

= How do I add reviews to my blog? =

Adding a review page is easy. Simply click on "Appearence" in the dashboard menu. Click on "Menu". Here you can adjust the navigation
to your website. Admins should see a album review page where they can add it to their top level web navigation. Save the changes. Now users 
can access a review page containing all reviews. 

= How do I add genres? =

In the "Album Review" menu item, click "Add Genre". You can easily add custom genres specifically tailored to your musical interests. Some common genres may be rock, pop, r&b, urban, soul however you can choose any type you want. These genres are then added to the genre pane in the add review page. By tagging genres to your reviews means that users can easily find your reviews that interest them.

= What do I need to display my products? =

The pre-requisites for Musicmate is that the admin has a OScommerce account created or has a OScommerce 
package stored locally. The only thing Musicmate needs is database information to determine where your products 
and images are contained. Once you know the database information like (hostname, username, password) and the url then 
it is easy. Simple click on the Store menuitem. Then fill out the form. Once filled, save the information. If the information 
is correct then products that are in your online store should be displayed on the sidebar of your website. 

= Why can I only see products in a sidebar? =

Currently products can only be seen in a sidebar. Wordpress users have many different themes and Musicmate feels that adding a sidebar widget looks more organised and does not interfere with your content. However for future releases, Musicmate hopes to provide the functionality to allow you to choose where you want to place products.
